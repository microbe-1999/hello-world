This repository is for practicing Github flow
I am a Biochemistry graduate, who is interested in Genomics. Bioinformatics is part of genomics and it uses coding languages such as Python,R,Java and many more. I want to learn how to code, not only for the sake of Bioinformatics, but also for the fast changing technology. Everything right now is leaning towards AI hence calls for a change of the human mindset
